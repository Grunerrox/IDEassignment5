        <h1>Crime incidents in the city of San Francisco</h1>

        <p>
            San Francisco was infamous for having some of the world's most notorious criminals on the top-notch security prison of
            Alcatraz island.<br/>
            Today, the prison is shutdown and the city is more known for the internet industry and are a very popular place to live
            for people employed in Silicon Valley companies such as Apple and Google. With this rising wealth inequality
            in the city, it is interesting to see where the crime incidents are taking place in San Francisco. To
            analyse this we have a dataset "sf_crime.geojson" which holds reports on 10.000 randomly samples of crimes
            that has happend across all of San Franciscos neighborhoods from 2003 to 2015. This we will visualize by
            plotting the map over San Francisco and then all the crimes in an interactive plot.
        </p>



        <!--Description: in this assignment you will mine a dataset (sf_crime.geojson) of 10.000 randomly sampled and-->
<!--geocoded crime incidents in the city of San Francisco. Your job is to make at least two significant data-->
<!--discoveries and support your findings with at least one map visualization. You may optionally use additional-->
<!--visualizations.-->
<!--The original dataset is described on https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime. There, you can also download the-->
<!--original CSV file (~800,000 incidents). We have created a police district dataset (sfpd_districts.geojson),-->
<!--which may or may not be useful to you.-->
<!--We have created the GeoJSON file using shuf and head (Linux commands) to sample the original CSV file and-->
<!--ogr2ogr to convert from CSV to GeoJSON.-->
<!--Allowed tools: You may use D3, CartoDB.com or another web-ready visualization tool.-->
<!--Hand in: please submit only a link to a webpage that contains your final solution.-->

<!--Formulate an brief description of the topic of your final project. Create a new discussion on the Absalon-->
<!--Discussion page and post the description of the project there. The projects must be pre-approved by me,-->
<!--before you start working on them (mainly to ensure that it is feasible within our time frame). I'll try to-->
<!--respond within 24 hours (with some potential exceptions around Christmas and New Year). Note that you might-->
<!--be asked to reconsider parts of your projects, so I recommend that you don't wait until the last moment to-->
<!--start thinking about this. This part (Part 2) of Assignment 5 will not be graded.-->

            The above visualization is made using Carto.com. The visualization takes the aggregation of crimes in the marked
            area. The area with the most crimes are yellow, and the areas with the least crime is dark blue.
            As we can see on our visualization the most crime overall, is located around the Central district.
