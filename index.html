            Description: in this assignment you will mine a dataset (sf_crime.geojson) of 10.000 randomly sampled and
            geocoded crime incidents in the city of San Francisco. Your job is to make at least two significant data
            discoveries and support your findings with at least one map visualization. You may optionally use additional
            visualizations.
            The original dataset is described on https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime. There, you can also download the
            original CSV file (~800,000 incidents). We have created a police district dataset (sfpd_districts.geojson),
            which may or may not be useful to you.
            We have created the GeoJSON file using shuf and head (Linux commands) to sample the original CSV file and
            ogr2ogr to convert from CSV to GeoJSON.
            Allowed tools: You may use D3, CartoDB.com or another web-ready visualization tool.
            Hand in: please submit only a link to a webpage that contains your final solution.

            Formulate an brief description of the topic of your final project. Create a new discussion on the Absalon
            Discussion page and post the description of the project there. The projects must be pre-approved by me,
            before you start working on them (mainly to ensure that it is feasible within our time frame). I'll try to
            respond within 24 hours (with some potential exceptions around Christmas and New Year). Note that you might
            be asked to reconsider parts of your projects, so I recommend that you don't wait until the last moment to
            start thinking about this. This part (Part 2) of Assignment 5 will not be graded.
